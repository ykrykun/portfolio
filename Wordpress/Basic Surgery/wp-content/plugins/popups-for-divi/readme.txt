A quick and easy way to create Popup layers inside the Divi Visual Builder!

== Description ==

After the plugin is activated, the Visual Builder displays a new tab called "Popup" in the Section Settings modal. In the "Popup" tab, you can turn a regular Section into a Popup!

It's super simple, as you can see on the plugins Demo Page: [divimode.com/divi-popup/demo](https://divimode.com/divi-popup/demo/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=popups-for-divi)

# ℹ️ How it works

First, activate the plugin (no configuration needed!)

1. Open up your Visual Builder and edit a Section - you'll see a new "Popup" tab in the Section Settings.
2. Toggle the option "This is a Popup" and set the "Popup ID" to something (e.g., "`newsletter-optin`"). Close the Section Settings.
3. Add a Button Module somewhere else on the page and set the "Link URL" to your Popup ID, with a leading "#" hash (e.g. "`#newsletter-optin`")
4. **That's all**. Save the page and exit the Visual Builder! Click on the button, and you'll see your Popup. Congratulations!

# Popups for Divi Course

During the past years, we've added a ton of features and have created a stable and powerful marketing plugin.

To celebrate the anniversary, we have created a six-day course that teaches you everything about the plugin. It walks you through the basics of creating your first Popup, shows possible ways to customize your Popup layouts and goes into advanced techniques and usages of the plugin.

> "The instruction emails really helped me to understand how to use the plugin correctly!"

The course is available in your **wp-admin Dashboard** right after you install and activate the plugin. Check out the screenshots to see the form. Also, have a look in the FAQ section, if you want to disable this feature.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin from the WordPress admin page "Plugins > Install"

or

1. Upload `popups-for-divi` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much performance does Popups for Divi need? =

Actually none! We designed it with maximum page performance in mind. Our tests did show literally no change in page loading speed.

The plugin will add a single line of CSS to the page output and load two files that currently are only about 31 kb in size (9kb gzipped). Both files are cached by the browser and used on all other pages of your website.

Those two files are the JS API and the popup CSS rules that center the popup, dim the background, etc.

= Is Popups for Divi compatible with Caching plugins? =

Yes, absolutely! There is no dynamic logic in the PHP code like other popup plugins have. Popups for Divi is a little bit of PHP but the main logic sits inside the small javascript library it provides. It works on the client-side and therefore is not restricted by caching plugins.

= Is this plugin compatible with every Divi version? =

This plugin is kept compatible with the latest Divi release.

We did test it with all releases since the initial Divi 3.0 release. Possibly it will also work with older versions

= Does this plugin also work with other themes/site builders? =

Yes, actually it will! But out of the box it is optimized to work with Divi 3.0 and later. If you use any other theme or site builder then you need to change the default options of the plugin via the `evr_divi_popup-js_data` filter.

For more details visit [divimode.com/divi-popup](https://divimode.com/divi-popup/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=popups-for-divi)

= Does this plugin display any ads? =

No. This plugin is free and does not display any ads. In fact, the plugin does not have a UI at all.

Popups for Divi is just that - a plain popup plugin, not our marketing strategy!

Since version 1.6.0 we now offer a six-day email course that shows you how the plugin works. You will see a notification in your wp-admin dashboard right after activating the plugin.

= Do you collect any details from my website? =

No, we do not collect or transmit any data from your website.

Since version 1.6.0 there is one exception: We now offer an email course that shows you how the plugin works. You will see a notification in your wp-admin dashboard right after activating the plugin. When you opt-in to receive the onboarding emails we will transmit the details you entered (your name and email address) to the plugin website to add you to our onboarding email-list.

= Is there a way to hide the onboarding notice? =

Yes, there is!

Since 1.6.0 the plugin offers an onboarding course that consists of 6 emails. We offer this course right after plugin activation in your wp-admin "Dashboard" page (nowhere else).

This onboarding notice is displayed to administrator users only. Once the user clicks on the "Dismiss" button, the message is never displayed again for them.

You can also globally disable the onboarding notice by defining the constant [`DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices#Disable_Nag_Notices) in your wp-config.php or themes function.php

= I need to revert to an older version =

When you experience any problems with the plugin, I would love you to first head over to the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/popups-for-divi/) and briefly share your issue with me.

Here's how you can revert to an older version of the plugin:

1. Go to the [Advanced View](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popups-for-divi/advanced/) Page and scroll down to the bottom.
2. Pick your version and click "Download" (you can choose any version since 1.5.1)
3. Now go to your wp-admin Panel and open the Plugins list
4. Deactivate and Delete the Popups for Divi plugin! *Note: You will not lose any data, but while the plugin is deactivated/missing your Popups might be visible like normal page content.*
5. On the Plugins page click the "Add New" button in the top and then click on "Upload Plugin"
6. Select the .zip file which you downloaded in Step 2 and upload it. Activate and you're done!

Alternatively, you can replace the `popups-for-divi` folder via FTP: Extract the .zip file which you downloaded in Step 2 and upload it to your `/wp-content/plugins` folder.
