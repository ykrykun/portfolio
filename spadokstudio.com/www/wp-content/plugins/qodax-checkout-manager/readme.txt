== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP 7.1 or greater is recommended
* MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Qodax Checkout Manager” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found it you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here.

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
